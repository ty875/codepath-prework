App Brainstorming:

I’d like to build an app called SmartCart, a shopping assistant that helps users find the best balance of price and quality. 
It would compare prices across stores, scan barcodes to check reviews and ratings, and send alerts for discounts or coupons. 
The app could also track spending habits and suggest high-quality, affordable options tailored to the user’s preferences.
